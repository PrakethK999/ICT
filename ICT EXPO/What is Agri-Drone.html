    <h1 style="text-align:center;"><u>What Are Agri-Drones</u></h1>
    <p>In India, it is agriculure that is the primary economy. Agriculture remains the chief source of income for the majority of the rural households. <br>
    Indiaâ€™s economy is also heavily dependent on the agricultural produce that constitutes a major portion of its exports as well. However, despite <br>
    mounting importance of agriculture, the sector is still far behind in technological advancements. Crop failure due to adverse weather conditions and <br>
    uncontrolled pests issues have been the key contributors to this scenario. Moreover, Indian farmers are even now dependent on monsoon rains for <br>
    irrigation and use age-old methods for other farming practices. Hence, the quality and quantity of agricultural produce is sometimes compromised <br>
    in spite of the relentless efforts of farmers.</p>

    <p>That is where Agri-Drones come into action. An agricultural drone is an aerial vehicle used in agriculture operations, mostly in yield optimization <br>
       and in monitoring crop growth and crop production. Drones are also used to plant seeds, spray crops with water, fertilisers, pesticides and herbicides.<br>
       As many of these operations can be carried out through intelligent flight modes, they are semi-automated which results in less time being spent on <br>
       the field which saves farmers money on labour equipment.<br>
